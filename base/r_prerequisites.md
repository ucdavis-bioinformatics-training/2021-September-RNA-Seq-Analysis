## R and Rstudio

The analyses in this course are done in R, using the Rstudio environment. Some familiarity with R will help you make the most of your time. While we will provide R code that can be run even if you have never used R before, we find that participants who have spent some time exploring R before the course get the maximum value out of our workshops. There is not be enough time to provide full instruction in introductory R, and still get through all of the material we need to cover.

Beginners without any previous knowledge will be able to complete this course, and achieve a more thorough understanding of the techniques and analyses covered, but will probably not be able to conduct an experiment on their own.

If you don't have any experience with R (or it has been a while) working through the first part of the [Introduction to R for Bioinformatics](https://ucdavis-bioinformatics-training.github.io/2021-March-Introduction-to-R-for-Bioinformatics/) course should give you a good foundation for this workshop. Those who are interested in running their own analyses may want to keep going through parts two and three, or even register for the introduction to R course.
