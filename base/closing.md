## Prerequisites for bioinformatics

* Access to a multi-core (24 cpu or greater), ‘high’ memory 64Gb or greater Linux server.
* Familiarity with the ’command line’ and at least one programming language.
* Basic knowledge of how to install software
* Basic knowledge of R (or equivalent) and statistical programming
* Basic knowledge of Statistics and model building

## The bottom line

* Spend the time (and money) planning and producing good quality, accurate and sufficient data for your experiment.
* Get to know to your data, develop and test expectations
* Result, you’ll spend much less time (and less money) extracting biological significance and results during analysis.

## Next Steps

My recommendation is to follow all of the instructions again, from the beginning on your own and send emails to [training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu](mailto:training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu) And we will be responsive to answering questions

##  Upcoming Workshops

Now in our 13th year of training researchers, the UC Davis Bioinformatics Core invites you to attend one or more of our 2020 workshops. The following workshops are suitable for beginners to advanced researchers, and are also of interest to those with some data analysis experience.

| :------------- |:-------------:|
|Aug 12 - Aug 14, 2020 | Introduction to Single Cell RNA-Seq  @ UC Davis |
|Aug 17 - Aug 19, 2020 | Advanced Single Cell RNA-Seq @ UC Davis |
|Oct 5 - Oct 9, 2020 | Bioinformatics: Command Line/R Prerequisites |
|Nov 30 - Dec 4, 2020 | Introduction to Analysis of Epigenetic Data |
