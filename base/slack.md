# Online Workshops with Slack

Text based communication will be conducted via a Slack channel. Staff will be monitoring the Slack channel to answer questions (and schedule a Zoom break out room if needed). If you know the answer to someone else's question, feel free to answer it.

## Direct Mentions

If you want to make sure that a particular person sees your comment in Slack, mention them by name, preceded by an "@" symbol.

## Threads

We like to use threads to keep messages on a single subject together. To reply to a comment in a thread, hold your mouse over the comment, and select the option "respond in thread."

 In the Slack desktop client, this opens a new window to the right of the main channel.

## Pinned Posts

Pinning a post can keep it from getting lost when the channel gets busy. To pin a post, hold your mouse over the post, select "more," and choose "pin post."

Pinned posts in a channel can be found quickly by clicking the channel information icon and selecting "Pinned" in the sidebar that appears.

## Searching Slack

Slack history is searchable. You can specify which channels to search, which people sent a message, and message content.
