This workshop will include a rich collection of lectures and hands-on sessions with individualized instructor support, covering both theory and tools associated with RNA-seq data analysis. Participants will explore experimental design, technology usage, cost estimation, data generation, and analysis (command-line and R) of RNA-Seq data, generated from the Illumina sequencing platform. Participants will use software and protocols, create and modify workflows, and diagnose/treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services. Exercises will be performed with provided datasets.

A basic understanding of the command line and R is a prerequisite for success in this course. We recommend beginners enroll in our introductory courses in CLI and R. After a brief review on the first day of the course,  we will not be providing instruction in basic CLI or R.

Participants must have access to a computer with a reliable connection to the internet, current versions of [R version 4.0](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), and an application that allows them to ssh into a server (see this [page](https://ucdavis-bioinformatics-training.github.io/2020-mRNA_Seq_Workshop/prerequisites/cli/logging-in))

If your department does not allow you to install software on your computer, please contact us ahead of time.

**Can I bring my own data?** … We will provide datasets for use during the workshop, as this helps to keep the workshop moving. There may be time, however, to discuss your own datasets and how you might work with them outside of the workshop.

**How much does it cost?** … The registration fee is $1,000 for current students, postdocs, staff and faculty at Univeristy of California campus' or UC National Labs (LBNL, LANL, LLNL), $1,200 for other academic or non-profit participants and $1,700 for other participants. We accept credit cards, as well as UC Davis recharge accounts, for payment.

**How do I apply?** … All registration is “first-come, first-served”. There is no application process.  So, sign up as soon as possible to ensure your place in the workshop.
